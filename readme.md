###  Mock Up for Week 1 Project

We were tasked with doing a mock up of a fantasy lawfirm website. We got together
as a group Thursday night and split up the work as shown above. We created a
Slack Channel labled "team-cool" in order to be communicate and show progress with
screenshots.

Caleb completed the Header, Footer and background of all 4 pages to make the
spacing easier to complete the other 4 pages over the weekend.

Ryan and Caleb met Friday evening and completed the 'WHO' and the 'WHAT' pages.

Due to scheduling conflicts, Frances and Zavier were not able to make it and
completed their work seperately.
